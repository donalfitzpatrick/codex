# Codex
This repository holds the source code for Codex, an application to provide accessible eBook conversion and DRM removal.  If you're looking for pre-built versions of the application with an installer, go [here](http://jscholes.net/projects/codex/).
To run the source and build release copies, you will need:
- Python 3.4
- wxPython Phoenix
- Everything in requirements.txt
- A portable calibre installation - drop it into the root directory of the repository
- The InnoSetup command line compiler

No support will be given to people wishing to run from source.  The code is made available in order to comply with the terms of the project's license agreement only.  Feel free to file issues here on GitHub, however.
